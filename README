Installation
============

On Unix systems, install the plugin using setuptools like this:

$ sudo python setup.py install

or as well

$ python setup.py install --user

Test the installation using 

$ pygmentize -L

where the 'snippet' filter appears if the installation is successful. In order
to uninstall the plugin, go to the installation folder (system-dependent) and
remove the python egg and the corresponding line in easy-install.pth.
