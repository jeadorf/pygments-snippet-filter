Installation
============

On Unix systems, install the plugin using setuptools like this:

1. $ python setup.py build

2. $ sudo python setup.py install
        or as well
    $ python setup.py install --user

3. Test the installation using 

    $ pygmentize -L

    where the 'snippet' filter appears if the installation is successful. In
    order to uninstall the plugin, go to the installation folder
    (system-dependent) and remove the python egg and the corresponding line in
    easy-install.pth.
